    <p class="myElement">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of 
        the printing and typesetting industry.
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy 
        text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley 
        of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only 
        five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially 
        unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
        Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
        including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
